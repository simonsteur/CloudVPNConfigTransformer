# CloudVPNConfigTransformer
CVCT is a tool that takes the generated vpn configuration from your cloud provider and allows you to transform it to your environment.

#Why
The idea comes from a time when I was working for a company that was starting to utilize different aws regions at a rapid pace. Being the person to both build the infrastructure in aws and also the network administrator for our on-premises environment; a tool like this  became very useful for me.
